The Editor is best used from laptop, desktop or tablet as it offers a better experience for the wider view of the visual components and options available with this editor.

# Presentation of the Editor tool


3 main areas, each serving their purpose.

1. Live Preview window is the most visible area where user can see and interact with elements of design

2. Editor floating Panel. This floating panel allow user to change content, inside the Live Preview window.
Select the element in the Live Preview window and notice that Editor floating Panel is dynamically changing its options for selected element.
For text blocks it shows a set of options, for images block shows another set of options. Intuitive, simple, but packed with magic.

*Clone and Delete options*
Editor panel has two very useful extra options next to the "x" icon on the right.
- The clone icon (top right, blue button, white icon) 
- Delete icon (top right, red button, white trash bin icon)

When a block element is selected in the main Preview window, an orange border indicates that the element is selected and Editor offers options for editing.
This is how to change the image
1. Select the image in Preview window, one click/touch to activate it
2. Choose the option to upload image from your library or from device

3. Top Options. This section of the tool is very important too.
*Insert* button shows what other blocks are available for current template. Not all templates have the same blocks available 
*Save* button is saving current progress
*Settings* goes back to settings page before the template is open in editing mode (can be renamed, see install process)
*Export* Option 1 - Copy HTML code (ready to paste in profile box)
               Option 2 - Take a screenshot - Save as image
