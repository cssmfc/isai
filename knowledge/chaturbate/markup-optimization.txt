Code and markup optimization

1. Minify inline markup
- do not add `target="` to any of the links
- use only the list of HTML tags accepted by the Chaturbate platform
- upon coding and generating the full layout code, remove empty spaces and all empty lines
- use system fonts, no self-hosted fonts
- opt for aesthetic but do not exaggerate with box-shadow
- verify that all HTML tags are properly open and close

2. Use of images
- if user is providing an external image, must end with accepted image extension: .gif, .png, .jpg, .jped
- suggest user to optimize their images first, a 2000px/2000px image should not be used as an social icon
- do not add `alt=` to images
- specified images for header can be full width or central avatar
- in generated templates where suitable, the same resources can be used multiple times
