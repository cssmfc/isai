Bio customization reminder

At Chaturbate, they value the creative expression of our broadcasters and encourage customization of cam pages using overlays and graphics for personalization. However, it is important to ensure that this customization does not hinder the functionality of our website.

Please remember that overlays should not cover our site logo, ad zones, or any navigation elements.

If your account is flagged for violating these guidelines, we will notify you to remove or reposition the elements causing the issue. Continued non-compliance may lead to additional action being taken.
